# Auto-Handoff: Context Threshold Reached

**Generated**: 2026-01-10T16:21:33.545Z
**Branch**: main
**Reason**: Context exceeded 65% (65%) - automatic handoff triggered before Claude's 75% autocompact

## Summary

This handoff was created automatically by the Adaptive Context Protocol (D15).
The previous agent's context was filling up, so a fresh session was spawned to continue.

## Session Chain

- **Chain ID**: chain-mk8ihlw0mnkcor
- **Session Number**: 3
- **Status**: Continuing work from previous session

## Resume Instructions

1. Read this handoff and the work state in `.grove/work-state.json`
2. Check `git status` and `git log --oneline -5` for recent changes
3. Run `grove next --json` to see the next task
4. Continue the work from where the previous agent left off

## Context for Continuation

The previous agent was working in this directory when context threshold was reached.
You have a fresh context window - use it wisely. If you approach 65%, consider
creating a proactive handoff before quality degrades.
